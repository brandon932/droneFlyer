#Drone Flyer

This project is based off an idea to have a warehouse full of drones that people can log into and then pick a drone to use to fly around an obstacle course, without the high cost of buying their own drones.

Drone Flyer uses the MEAN stack and various libraries to make this project possible.

##MVP

The MVP will consist of:
  * being able to check out drones while not logged in.
  * log in and select a drone to fly
  * Fly a drone remotely.
